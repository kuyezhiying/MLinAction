# MLinAction
This project will realize all the algorithms in the book "Machine Learning in Action".


# Contents
The algorithms within the project conclude:<br>
##1. kNN  
>  Here, kNN is used in two situation :  
>> Â 1) classify the person from a meeting website,  
>>  2) recognize the handwriting digits. 

##2. Decision Tree(DT)
>  Here, DT is constructed with the ID3 algorithm, it is used to :  
>>  1) predicate the class of a ocean creature (whether it is a kind of fish),  
>>  2) predicate the class of lenses.
