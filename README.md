# MLinAction
This project will realize all the algorithms in the book "Machine Learning in Action".


# Contents
The algorithms within the project conclude:<br>
##1. kNN  
>Here, kNN is used in two situation :  
>>1) classify the person from a meeting website,  
>>2) recognize the handwriting digits. 

##2. Decision Tree(DT)
>Here, DT is constructed with the ID3 algorithm, it is used to :  
>>1) predicate the class of a ocean creature (whether it is a kind of fish),  
>>2) predicate the class of lenses.  

##3. Naive Bayes(NB)
>Here, NB is applied in the following three situation :
>>1) Text classification : classify the class of speech (abusive or formal) on the posting board of dalmation fans,  
>>2) Spam detection : filter the spam from the email list,  
>>3) Area analysis : analysis the common top words in an area from the personal ads.  

##4. Logistic Regression(LR)
>Here, LR use the (stochastic) gradient ascent methods to optimize the parameters. The trained model is used to :
>>1) classify the points in a plane
>>2) predicate the death ratio of ill horses from colic features
